# hello-world
my introduction to programming with the help of github

.

Greetings, I'm a beginner in the coding world and I'm a new member in the github community and want to learn more. I try to forsee my satisfactions for a finished project. I will try to not give up half-way through and I'm more than willing to listen to other people in their criticism, pointers, ect...
A little less about me, yet more on something I've been wanting to write down for myself (a bit of venting) I've had so many ideas on different video game concepts that its been overwhelming, and especially demotivating when I lack the required experience to do certain specific functions that I creatively had in mind. I give up easily, and that's exactly what I want to change about myself. For my passions derive from the stories that dance so elegantly, an imagined movie from which only I can see. Incredible stories that aren't told by mouth nor letter nigh sight. I'm willing to change for the better because I want to succeed and want to share my projects and stories to other people! (Like anyone else for that matter. I wish them the best as well.)

It has always struck to me knowing that while seeing other people's successes muddles my mind with jealousy, envy. It worries me, I have these bad thoughts against those who have had earned a fulfiled and happy life, Unlike me... For now. At the very least, I would like to change that envy into benign envy (yes i read the wikipedia page for the right term). From which I give admiration to those who have done well in certain things, and take it upon myself to strive for the better, to motivate myself to become a better person, seeing as someone has done it, means its possible.
Yet at the same time I want to show others of my successes, like a show off... so I want to be better than that, with every inch of step of the way il make it through the stairwell of dedication and patience. 
I'm 18 by the way, pleased to meet you. 

I'm just gonna go ahead and continue the tutorial now xd
